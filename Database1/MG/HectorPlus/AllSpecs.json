  "LatestUpdate": [
    "Latest Update: MG has increased the prices of the Hector Plus by up to Rs 38,000. MG Hector Plus Price: The Hector Plus is priced from Rs 13.63 lakh to Rs 19.61 lakh (ex-showroom except for Kerala). MG Hector Plus Variants: While the 6-seater Hector Plus is available in three variants (Super, Smart, and Sharp), MG offers the 7-seater Hector Plus in four (Style, Super, Smart, and Select). MG Hector Plus Powertrains: MG has provided the SUV with both petrol and diesel engines. The 1.5-litre turbo-petrol unit, generating 143PS and 250Nm, gets the standard 6-speed MT and an optional 6-speed DCT or the new 8-speed CVT gearbox. The DCT and CVT options, however, are limited to the 6-seater variants. MG has also provided the turbo-petrol engine with the option of a 48V mild-hybrid system, with only a 6-speed MT. The 2.0-litre diesel engine, paired with a 6-speed manual gearbox, produces 170PS and 350Nm. MG Hector Plus Features: The Hector Plus now gets 18-inch dual-tone alloy wheels, a wireless phone charger, and ventilated front seats (from the 5-seater Hector). Features like the panoramic sunroof, rain-sensing wipers, powered tailgate, 8-colour ambient lighting, and 10.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system (with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay) have been retained. MG Hector Plus Safety: Standard safety features include electronic stability program (ESP), front and rear parking sensors, hill hold control, ISOFIX child seat anchors, ABS with EBD and brake assist, dual front airbags, and traction control. The top-spec variant gets up to six airbags. MG Hector Plus Rivals: It rivals the Toyota Innova Crysta, Mahindra XUV500, Tata Safari, Mahindra XUV700, and the Hyundai Alcazar."
