    "Toyota Fortuner Price: Toyota retails the Fortuner from Rs 30.34 lakh and Rs 38.30 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). Toyota Fortuner Seating Capacity: The SUV comes in a 7-seater layout. Toyota Fortuner Powertrains: It is offered with both petrol and diesel engines. While the 2.7-litre petrol unit (166PS/245Nm) is offered in the same state of tune as before, the upgraded 2.8-litre turbo-diesel motor (204PS/500Nm) has also been introduced. The facelifted Fortuner is offered with both 6-speed manual and automatic transmission options as well as rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive systems. Toyota Fortuner Features: The facelifted Fortuner is available in two versions: the standard Fortuner and the Legender. Both get an updated front end, new LED headlamps, bumper design, and an updated layout for the rear LED tail lamps. Both cars feature new designs for the alloy wheels, 18-inch units for the base model, and dual-tone 20-inch wheels for the Legender variant. Toyota offers a larger touchscreen infotainment system (9-inch unit for the Legender and 8-inch unit for the base version) with Apple CarPlay and T-Connect for connected car features. Other feature updates for the Legender variant include a 360-degree parking camera, wireless charging pad, ambient lighting, and a tweaked instrument cluster. It also gets a kick-to-open feature for the powered tailgate. Toyota Fortuner Safety: Toyota has equipped the SUV with up to seven airbags, vehicle stability control, hill assist, and ABS with EBD. Toyota Fortuner Rivals: It goes up against the Ford Endeavour, Mahindra Alturas G4, MG Gloster, VW Tiguan Allspace, and the 2021 Skoda Kodiaq."
