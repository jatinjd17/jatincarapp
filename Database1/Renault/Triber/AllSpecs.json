  "LatestUpdate": [
    "Latest Update: Renault is offering the Triber with benefits of up to Rs 55,000 this July. Renault Triber Price: Renault retails the Triber between Rs 5.50 lakh and Rs 7.95 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). Renault Triber Variants: The Triber is available in four variants: RXE, RXL, RXT, and RXZ. Renault Triber Seating Capacity: Renault offers the sub-4m crossover MPV in a 7-seater layout. Renault Triber Powertrain: It is powered by a 1.0-litre petrol engine (72PS/96Nm), mated to either a 5-speed manual or an AMT gearbox. Renault will also introduce a 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine (100PS/160Nm) in the crossover MPV. This motor was showcased at Auto Expo 2020, but its launch has now been pushed to 2022. This unit will likely come paired with a 5-speed manual and a CVT automatic. Renault Triber Features: The Triber gets an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a height-adjustable driver's seat, steering-mounted audio and calling controls, AC vents for second and third-row seats, a digital instrument cluster, and push-button start/stop. Renault Triber Safety: Renault offers dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, and rear parking sensors as standard across all variants. Renault Triber Rivals: While it doesn't have any direct rival, the Triber is an alternative to mid-size hatchbacks such as the Maruti Swift, Hyundai Grand i10 Nios, Ford Freestyle, and Ford Figo. It also rivals the Datsun GO+. That said, if you are looking for a rugged utility vehicle, you could even consider the Mahindra Bolero."
